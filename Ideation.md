Project Title: Trendz
1. Introduction
A brief introduction to your website idea. State the goals of the project.
The values / benefits (tangible and intangible) this application can bring to a company/organization/end-user.

- I want to create a frontend website that uses News APIs or those like it to get different headlines and stories covering the same topic. The main goal is for users to be able to come to this site and see how different news, journalist, and possibly prominent social media users cover the same event(s). This will bring value by helping fight media bias and cause more people to review all the opinions and facts and decide for themselves. I hope to have a cleaner UI than what is out there. Many similar sites are cluttered with information and don't always show multiple sources for one story.

2. Expected List of Features
A brief list of features that you expect your website to support.
Brief justifications for including these features.

- Filtering based on topic/category
- Filtering based on political spectrum
- Filtering based on type of reporting
- Link to stories' article/video
- headline searchability
- trending feed

3. Market Survey
Do a survey of the Web to find about five web sites that might have similar ideas as yours.
Briefly compare the features of these applications with your application idea.

Vulnerabilities in other sites which I hope to address include:
- The UI of other applications are not super clean
- Not a full display of different articles
- Difficult to navigate website
